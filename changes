1. 
Wallpapers can now be cleanly changed with no terminal hangup, instantly disowns
and doesn't show any output. To change wallpaper, type `setwp <nameOfWallPaper>`
As long as the wallpaper is contained in the ~/Wallpapers directory

2.
Path autocompletes case insensitively, meaning `cd wall` would autocomplete to
`cd Wallpapers` when pressing TAB.

3. 
Instantly displays options when path ambiguity arises, pressing TAB while having
typed in `cd .config/hypr/hy` would instantly become `cd .config/hypr/hypr` and
immediately display the two options as `hyprpaper.conf` and `hyprland.conf`.

4.
Made a custom bash prompt completely from scratch, doesn't support showing current 
working git repository but that shouldn't be too hard to add.

5.
More PoE improvements, found a new solid launch option that people are raving about.
Ran a solo map with no issues at all, then ran a minotaur map with Vito on his new char,
slight stutters on the first 2 packs as it downloaded his skill shaders, but no issues after that.
People are saying that games usually run super smooth once all major shaders have been downloaded through a
bit of play time. Read this post for good info:
